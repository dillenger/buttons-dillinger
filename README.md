# phoenity-buttons
About this Add-on:

Adds some toolbar buttons using phoenity icons.

Complete rewrite for Thunderbird 112, support for older versions has been removed.

Currently only a few (unmovable) buttons are available:
- Search Messages, Config Editor, Developer Tools, Preferences & Restart.
- All buttons are inserted at the end of the Tab Bar, but can be moved.
- It may be necessary to restart Thunderbird for buttons to move or appear.
- It may be necessary to move buttons on the Tab Bar to make them "stick".

For some of the old toolbar buttons separate extensions have been written.
