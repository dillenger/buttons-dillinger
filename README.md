About this Add-on:

Adds some toolbar buttons using phoenity icons.

Complete rewrite for Thunderbird 78, support for older versions has been removed.

Currently only a few (unmovable) buttons are available:
- Search Messages, Config Editor, Developer Tools, Preferences & Restart.
- The Restart button is inserted at the end of the Tab Bar.
- The Search Messages button is inserted after the Quick Filter button.
- All other buttons are inserted after the Add-ons button.
- Inserted buttons will disappear if you remove their "parent" button.
- It may be necessary to restart Thunderbird for buttons to move or appear.

For some of the old toolbar buttons separate extensions have been written.
